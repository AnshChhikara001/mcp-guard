# mcp-guard

[![CI](https://github.com/AnshChhikara001/mcp-guard/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AnshChhikara001/mcp-guard/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A security gateway for AI agents that use MCP tools, with a red-team eval that measures how many attacks it stops.

Work in progress. Design decisions are in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) and the project vocabulary in [`GLOSSARY.md`](GLOSSARY.md).

## Layout

| Folder | Package | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gateway/` | `mcp_guard.gateway` | The Gateway, an MCP server that decides every Tool call |
| `agent/` | `mcp_guard.agent` | The demo Agent |
| `fake_servers/` | `mcp_guard.fake_servers` | The six fake bank MCP servers |
| `eval/` | `mcp_guard.redteam` | The Red-team eval |

## Development

Needs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and Docker.

```sh
cp .env.example .env   # optional; the defaults work locally
make install           # Python 3.13, all packages and dev tools, from uv.lock
make db                # local Postgres on localhost:5432
make check             # ruff, pyright (strict) and pytest, as CI runs them
```
